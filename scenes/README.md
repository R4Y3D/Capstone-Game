# [**Capstone Game Project**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rZza9AfgmZTd8yqIgBt86HfKifJcGj7BONH4dn8Ree0/edit?usp=sharing)

For this project, you may work in **self-selected groups** or individually.

---

## **Objective**

Design and create a game using **Godot 4** that can be played and completed within a **10-15 minute timeframe**. Your game should be engaging, embody clear objectives, and provide an enjoyable experience for players.

---

## **Constraints**

- **Duration:** The game's total playtime should not exceed 15 minutes, ensuring a concise yet engaging experience.  
- **Clear Objective:** The game must have a well-defined objective, providing players with a clear goal or set of goals.  
- **Rule-set:** Incorporate a simple yet effective set of game mechanics and rules that are easy for players to understand and interact with.

---

## **Submission Requirements**

1. **Conduct a playtest on 12/6:**  
   - Conduct an in-class playtest of your game on the last day of class.  

---

## **Grading Criteria (Total 30 Points)**

1. **Meeting Stated Design Goals (0-5):**  
   - Does the game have a clear objective, perspective (character/world/universe), ending condition, and emotional impact?  

2. **Tutorial (0-5):**  
   - Does the game itself teach players how to play it?  
   - *Note:* During in-class playtests, you will not be allowed to explain how to play the game, so ensure the game teaches players through interaction.  

3. **Robustness (0-5):**  
   - Can the game run from beginning to end without crashing?  

4. **Polish (0-5):**  
   - Does the game show extra effort on visuals, sounds, or "Juice"?  

5. **In-class Playtest (+5):**  
   - 10 points for having a playable prototype on the final day of class.  

6. **Publishing to Itch.io (+5):**  
   - 3 Points for successfully publishing your game on Itch.io and submitting it that way.

## **Tips for Success**

### **Begin with Basics:**  
Start with simple game mechanics and gradually add complexity. Remember, a well-executed simple game is better than a complex one that's unfinished or unplayable.  

### **Iterative Design:**  
Utilize playtesting feedback to refine gameplay and mechanics. Don't be afraid to make changes based on player experiences.  

### **Utilize Godot Resources:**  
Take advantage of Godot's documentation, tutorials, and community forums to overcome technical challenges.  

### **Collaborate and Communicate:**  
Work closely with your group members, dividing tasks based on skills and interests, and maintain open lines of communication throughout the project development.
